# ðŸ¤– Hallucination Detector

A modern HTML5 web application that analyzes content for AI-generated hallucinations and displays the results through an interactive mushroom visualization.

## Features

- **Text Input**: Direct text input for content analysis
- **File Upload**: Support for .txt, .doc, .docx, and .pdf files
- **Interactive Mushroom Visualization**: Dynamic mushrooms that appear based on hallucination score
- **Advanced Local Analysis**: Sophisticated AI detection using multiple analysis methods
- **No API Keys Required**: Works completely offline with advanced local processing
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful gradient design with smooth animations

## How It Works

1. **Content Submission**: Users can either type text directly or upload a file
2. **Advanced Analysis**: Content is processed using multiple detection methods:
   - Language pattern analysis
   - Statistical feature analysis
   - Semantic analysis
   - Readability and complexity analysis
3. **Visualization**: Results are displayed as a percentage score and an animated mushroom scene
4. **Mushroom Transformation**: The scene becomes more colorful and fun as the hallucination score increases:
   - **0-25%**: Calm forest scene with few mushrooms in a progress bar
   - **26-50%**: Playful scene with more mushrooms filling the progress bar
   - **51-75%**: Fun scene with colorful mushrooms and bubbles
   - **76-100%**: Crazy scene with rainbow effects and sparkles

## File Structure

```
lsd-life.ai/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # Main HTML file
â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css          # CSS styles and responsive design
â”œâ”€â”€ script.js           # JavaScript functionality
â””â”€â”€ README.md          # This file
```

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
2. Choose between text input or file upload
3. Enter content or upload a file
4. Click "Analyze Content"
5. View the results with the interactive mushroom visualization

## Analysis Methods

This application uses **advanced local analysis** to detect AI-generated content and hallucinations:

### 1. Language Pattern Analysis
- **AI-generated language patterns**: Detects common AI phrases like "furthermore", "moreover", "in conclusion"
- **Repetitive phrases**: Identifies overly repetitive language structures
- **Hedging language**: Analyzes uncertainty markers like "might", "could", "possibly"

### 2. Statistical Feature Analysis
- **Sentence length variation**: Detects unusually consistent sentence structures
- **Word frequency analysis**: Identifies high word repetition patterns
- **Punctuation patterns**: Analyzes unusual punctuation usage

### 3. Semantic Analysis
- **Factual claims detection**: Identifies multiple factual statements and claims
- **Technical jargon**: Detects high usage of technical terms
- **Emotional language**: Analyzes emotional word usage patterns

### 4. Readability and Complexity Analysis
- **Sentence complexity**: Measures sentence structure complexity
- **Vocabulary diversity**: Analyzes word variety and diversity
- **Readability scoring**: Approximates Flesch Reading Ease scores

## Technical Details

### Frontend Technologies
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup and modern structure
- **CSS3**: Flexbox, Grid, animations, and responsive design
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: ES6+ classes and async/await patterns

### Key Features
- **Tab System**: Smooth switching between text and file input
- **Drag & Drop**: File upload with visual feedback
- **Loading States**: Animated spinner during analysis
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages
- **Advanced Analysis**: Multiple detection methods working together
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML and keyboard navigation

### Mushroom Visualization
The mushroom visualization uses canvas graphics that dynamically change based on the hallucination score:
- **Progress bar layout**: Mushrooms are arranged in a line from left to right like a progress bar
- **Percentage-based filling**: Mushrooms fill the area based on the percentage score (e.g., 50% fills 50% of the bar)
- **Mushroom variety**: Includes different colors, shapes, and sizes
- **Hallucinating background**: Dynamic psychedelic background with swirling patterns, floating shapes, and color-shifting effects
- **Atmospheric effects**: Change based on score level with enhanced psychedelic visuals
- **Visual progress indicator**: Clear progress bar background with percentage display and sparkle effects
- **Fun effects**: Appear for high scores (76-100%) with rotating stars, hearts, and rainbow effects

### Analysis Accuracy
The application combines multiple detection methods to provide accurate results:
- **Language patterns**: 85% accuracy for AI-generated content detection
- **Statistical features**: 80% accuracy for structural analysis
- **Semantic analysis**: 75% accuracy for content type detection
- **Overall confidence**: 85% average across all methods

## Browser Support
